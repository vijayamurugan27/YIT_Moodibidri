I've converted your Flask application into a modular, well-organized structure. Here are the key improvements and organization principles I've implemented:
Project Structure
The application is now organized into logical modules:

config.py: Centralized configuration management
app/: Main application package
app/models/: Database models
app/api/: API endpoints (JSON responses)
app/views/: HTML views and templates
run.py: Application entry point

Key Improvements

Application Factory Pattern: Uses create_app() function for better testing and configuration management
Blueprints: Separates API routes and HTML views into different blueprints for better organization
Model Enhancements: Added helper methods like create(), update(), and delete() to the Student model
Error Handling: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and proper error responses
Configuration Management: Environment-based configuration (development, production, testing)
CLI Commands: Custom Flask CLI command for API testing
Validation: Input validation for both API and web forms
Flash Messages: User feedback for web interface actions

How to Set It Up

Create the directory structure as shown in the comments
Create each file with the corresponding content from the artifact
Install dependencies: pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy
Run the application: python run.py
Test the API: flask --app run.py test-api

Benefits of This Structure

Maintainable: Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
Scalable: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
Testable: Application factory pattern enables easy unit testing
Configurable: Different configurations for different environments
Reusable: Modular components can be imported and used elsewhere

The application maintains all the original functionality while being much more organized and following Flask best practices!Retry
