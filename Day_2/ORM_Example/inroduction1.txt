ORM Basics 

Here's a brief overview of ORM basics with SQLAlchemy: 
Defining Models 

    Use the db.Model class to define database models.
    Define columns using db.Column instances.
    Use primary_key=True to specify primary keys.
     

CRUD Operations 

    Create: Use db.session.add() to add new instances to the database.
    Read: Use db.session.query() to query the database.
    Update: Use db.session.commit() to commit changes to the database.
    Delete: Use db.session.delete() to delete instances from the database.
     

Relationships 

    Use db.relationship to define relationships between models.
    Use backref to specify bidirectional relationships.
     

Querying 

    Use db.session.query() to construct queries.
    Use filter(), order_by(), and limit() to filter and paginate results.
